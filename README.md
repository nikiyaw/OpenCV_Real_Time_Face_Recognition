# OpenCV_Real_Time_Face_Recognition
 
There are 3 main steps to help build a real time face recognition application:
1. Collect training dataset.
2. Train the model.
3. Use the trained model to recognize real time webcam images and provide a name along with a accuracy score.

I want to also acknowledge the help that I get from this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/real-time-face-recognition-an-end-to-end-project-b738bb0f7348.
It is an excellent source to learn the basics of object recognition.
